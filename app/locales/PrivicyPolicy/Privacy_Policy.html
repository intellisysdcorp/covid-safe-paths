        knows that you care about how your personal information is used and how
        it is shared and we thank you for trusting us to do so with care and
        prudence. This Privacy Policy describes the policies of the COVID-RD app
        and the procedures on the collection, transmission, manipulation,
        storage, disclosure and treatment of your information when you access
        our said app.</span

        172-13 of December 15, 2013, which aims at the comprehensive protection
        of personal data established in files, public registers, data banks or

        application, including those declared by the user in the monitoring
        functionality, will be processed by the Ministry of Public Health for
        the purpose of surveying and containment related to the Coronavirus
        pandemic (COVID-19) and communicated within the framework of the
        provisions of the High Level Commission for the Prevention and Control

      <span
        >The personal data collected in the symptom reporting process is found
        in a database managed by the Epidemiology Directorate of the Ministry of
        Public Health. The Ministry of Public Health has implemented security
        policies, standards and technical measures to protect your personal data
        against unauthorized access or modification, misuse or disclosure,
        illegal destruction or accidental loss. To protect the data we store, we
        regularly audit your systems to detect possible vulnerabilities and
        attacks. However, since the Internet is not a one hundred percent secure
        environment, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any
        information that you transmit through the use of the APP or the
        guarantee that your information cannot be accessed, revealed, altered or
        destroy for breach of any of our physical, technical or management
        security measures. In the event that personal information is compromised
        as a consequence of a security breach, the Ministry of Public Health
        will notify persons whose personal information has been compromised as
        soon as it becomes aware of it.</span

      <span
        >In the case of personal data of positive COVID-19 users who give their
        consent to participate in contact tracing or Contact Tracing, such data
        is temporarily stored in a database managed by the Ministry of Economy,
        Planning and Development (MEPYD) and are only used to validate if there
        is a laboratory test in your name with a positive result. This is done
        to prevent false reports in Contact Tracing. After validation is done,
        that personal information is removed. In the case of geolocation data,
        these are transmitted completely anonymously to the server (it only
        indicates latitude, longitude, date and time). We use anonymization
        techniques that effectively allow anonymization of personal data so that
        it cannot be linked to a specific person. This anonymous transmission of
        the geolocation of the positives is carried out until the application
        determines through validation with the Ministry of Public Health that
        the user has received her epidemiological discharge or she decides to
        deactivate Contact Tracing.</span
