# COVID-RD

COVID-RD allows you to view the data of validated COVID-19 cases in the Dominican Republic and report the symptoms if you are possibly infected with the virus to the Ministry of Public Health (MSP).

In this installment of COVID-RD you will have access to:

- Register your symptoms in a survey prepared by the General Directorate of Epidemiology (DIGEPI) with the intention of ruling out or validating whether it is necessary to go to a health entity for the COVID-19 test
- Validate if you have been in contact with other users who test positive for COVID-19
- Map with the list of hospitals and laboratories closest to your residence
- Access the Aurora chatbot
- Consult the MSP bulletins, relevant information from the Presidency and advice related to the pandemic

## Developer Setup

Here's a list of technologies you need to run the project:

- Node.js 10+
- Java JDK 8+
- Yarn
- React Native
- Android Studio Lastest

### Building

After cloning the repository follow the next steps

- If it's empty, click on " + Create Virtual Devices ..." button in the bottom left side, look and select `Pixel 2` item and click the "Next" button. Then select API `29` and click "Next" and "Finish" button.

### 6. Run configuration files

run the following configuration files depending on your operating system, if you are using Linux / Mac run the files with the **.sh** extension, in case you have windows with the **.bat** extension.

> **Note:** Pay attention to any instruction that pops up during runtime.

```
dev_setup
1_start_react
2_start_android_app
```

## Running

**Note:** In some cases, these procedures can lead to the error `Failed to load bundle - Could not connect to development server`. In these cases, kill all other react-native processes and try it again.

#### Android (Windows, Linux, macOS)

```
1- yarn start
2- yarn run run-android -- another console
```

Device storage can be cleared by long-pressing on the app icon in the simulator, clicking "App info", then "Storage", and lastly, "Clear Storage".

#### iOS (macOS only)

```
yarn install:pod ## only needs to be ran once

1- yarn start
2- yarn run run-ios -- another console
```

Device storage can be cleared by clicking "Hardware" on the system toolbar, and then "Erase all content and settings".

### Release Builds

Generating a release build is an optional step in the development process.

- [Android instructions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android)

### Debugging

[react-native-debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) is recommended. This tool will provide visibility of the JSX hierarchy, breakpoint usage, monitoring of network calls, and other common debugging tasks.

## Testing

Tests are ran automatically through Github actions - PRs are not able to be merged if there are tests that are failing.

### Unit Test

To run the unit tests:

```
yarn test --watch
```

[Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) is used as a quick way to verify that the UI has not changed. To update the snapshots:

```
yarn update-snapshots
```

### e2e Test

**Note:** Right now, there is only e2e test support for iOS.

e2e tests are written using [_detox_](https://github.com/wix/Detox). Screenshots of each test run are saved to `e2e/artifacts` for review.

To run the e2e tests:

```
yarn detox-setup ## only needs to be run once
yarn build:e2e:ios ## needs to be run after any code change
yarn test:e2e:iphone{11, -se, 8}
```
